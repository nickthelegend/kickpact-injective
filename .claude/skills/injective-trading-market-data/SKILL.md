## Injective Trading Market Data, Skill Guide

Query live market data from Injective's on-chain perpetuals exchange.
All data is pulled from the Injective Indexer (gRPC) and is real-time.

## When to apply

-

Sample prompts: `./references/sample-prompts.md`

## Important

### Notes

- Prices are in USDT with 6 decimal places internally; returned as human-readable floats.
- Oracle prices are aggregated from Band Protocol and Pyth Network feeds.
- Funding rates are not yet exposed via MCP tools - check Helix UI for funding.
- Market data is cached in-process for 30 seconds to reduce latency on repeated calls.
- **`minPriceTickSize` from the indexer is in chain format.** For USDT markets, divide by 10^6 to get the human-readable tick size. `minQuantityTickSize` is already in human format (not scaled by quote decimals).

### Market symbols

See: `./references/market-symbols.md`

Use `market_list` for the complete current set, as new markets are added through Injective governance.

## Activities

### List all active perpetual futures markets with full metadata

```
market_list
```

Returns per market:
- `symbol` - e.g. BTC, ETH, INJ
- `marketId` - 0x... hex ID used on-chain
- `oraclePrice` - current oracle mark price (USDT)
- `minQuantityTickSize` - minimum order size
- `minPriceTickSize` - minimum price increment
- `initialMarginRatio` - minimum margin (1/maxLeverage)
- `maintenanceMarginRatio`
- `makerFeeRate` / `takerFeeRate`

### Get the current oracle price for a single market.

```
market_price
  symbol: BTC    ← or ETH, INJ, SOL, ATOM, etc.
```

Returns: `{ symbol, price, marketId }`

### "What markets are available?"

```
market_list → filter/display by symbol
```

### "What's the current BTC price?"
```
market_price BTC
```

### "What's the max leverage for ETH?"

```
market_list → find ETH → compute 1 / initialMarginRatio
```

(e.g. initialMarginRatio 0.05 → 20x max leverage)

### "Is the ETH market liquid enough for a $10,000 position?"

```
market_list → check ETH minQuantityTickSize and current oracle price
```

Injective uses an on-chain order book.
For large orders, use limit orders or split into multiple market orders to reduce slippage.
